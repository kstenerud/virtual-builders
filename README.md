Virtual Builders
================

Builds somewhat opinionated virtual environments using KVM and LXC/LXD.

I spent quite a lot of time figuring out the best way to set up various environments, and didn't want to lose them to a non-deterministic setup like a server install somewhere, so I've made builders for them.



Usage
-----

For best results, run `echo 5000 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/keys/maxkeys`. Otherwise you may run into problems with Docker inside of lxc: `could not create session key: disk quota exceeded.`

Simply run the top level `build.sh` to see what options you have. It will list all environments it can build.

Build.sh is just a launcher for the real build scripts `machine-builders/xyz/build.sh`. You can look inside them to see how they operate, or just call `build.sh xyz -H` to see how to invoke them.

For example, to get help for starting a samba container:

    ./build.sh samba -H

To start a samba container with the hostname "shared" that shares /mnt/myshare as writable under the name "great-stuff":

    ./build.sh samba -n shared -m /mnt/myshare:great-stuff:w

Look at the `README.md` files inside the `machine-builders` subdirs for more information about each virtual environment.
